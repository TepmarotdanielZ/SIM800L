**1. WHAT IS GSM?**

GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobile, is a cellular standard primarily designed for mobile communication. GSM is a standard developed to facilitate communication between mobile devices. It's a digital cellular network technology that enables users to make calls, send texts, and access basic data services like SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service). GSM networks operate on various frequency bands globally, allowing mobile subscribers international roaming capabilities.


**2. WHAT IS GPRS?**


GPRS, which stands for General Packet Radio Service. GPRS is an enhancement of the GSM standard that enables mobile data transmission. It introduces packet-switched technology to GSM networks, allowing for faster data transfer rates compared to traditional circuit-switched methods. GPRS enables features like internet browsing, email access, and other data-intensive applications on mobile devices. It optimizes network resources by only using bandwidth when data is being transmitted, making it more efficient for data communication than its predecessor.
